    <p><strong>Prague Castle Escape</strong> is a mobile game developed as a free app by the developer for fun. This Privacy Policy explains how your information is collected, used, and protected when you use the app.</p>

    <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>The app collects <strong>location data</strong> to enable outdoor gameplay experiences that depend on your real-world position. Your location is used only while the game is active and is not stored after the game ends.</p>
    <p>At the end of the game, the app asks you to enter a name or nickname of your choice. This name, along with your game result (e.g., score or completion status), is saved in a secure Firebase Firestore database. This allows you to view your results later or compare them with others.</p>
    <p>We <strong>do not collect</strong> any other personally identifiable information such as email addresses, phone numbers, or contact lists.</p>

    <h2>2. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We <strong>do not share</strong> any of your data with third parties.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
    <p>Your location is <strong>not stored</strong> or logged after the game session ends. Your result and the name you provide are stored in <strong>Firebase Firestore</strong>, a secure cloud database hosted by Google.</p>

    <h2>4. Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable precautions to protect your data. All stored data is secured using Firebase's built-in security rules and access controls.</p>

    <h2>5. Childrenâ€™s Privacy</h2>
    <p>This app is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we discover that a child has provided us with personal information, we will delete such data immediately.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page.</p>

    <h2>7. Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, feel free to contact us at:</p>
